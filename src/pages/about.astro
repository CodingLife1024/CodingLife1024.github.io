          Hi, I’m Riddhi — an engineer who likes building things that listen to
          the world. I recently graduated from IIT Delhi and spend most of my
          time somewhere between code, climate science, and quiet curiosity.
          This blog is where those threads meet.
        </p>

        <p>
          I work at the intersection of systems and signal — from distributed
          computing and deep learning models to environmental sound
          classification and sensor-driven hardware projects. I enjoy designing
          efficient systems (MPI, CUDA, optimization problems) just as much as
          training neural networks to interpret messy real-world data.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lately, I’ve been exploring machine learning for environmental and
          atmospheric applications, building open and low-cost tools, and
          studying climate modeling. Long term, I hope to pursue a Master’s in
          Atmospheric Sciences or Oceanography — because understanding the
          planet feels like the most meaningful system to debug.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of technical work, I care deeply about thoughtful writing,
          independence, and asking difficult questions — about technology,
          research, and life design. This space is part lab notebook, part
          thinking-out-loud journal.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you’re interested in ML, systems engineering, climate science, or
          building things from scratch — welcome. I’m glad you’re here.
